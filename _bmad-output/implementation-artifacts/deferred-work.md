  summary: Real statement PDFs remain reachable in git history despite untracking `bank_data/`
  evidence: Review noted prior commits still contain `bank_data/*.pdf` blobs; history rewrite was Ask First / out of this story

- source_spec: `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/spec-1-1-scaffold-compose-app-with-health-checks.md`
  summary: Pin Compose/base image digests for reproducible rebuilds
  evidence: Floating `postgres:16` / `python:3.12-slim` / `node:20-bookworm-slim` tags can drift silently

- source_spec: `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/spec-1-1-scaffold-compose-app-with-health-checks.md`
  summary: Harden docker-compose.prod.yml (secret assertions, docs off, bind localhost)
  evidence: Prod overlay currently only adds restart policies and NODE_ENV/ENVIRONMENT labels

## Deferred from: code review of spec-1-1-scaffold-compose-app-with-health-checks.md (2026-08-03)

- Enforce `FINANCE_HELPER_DATA` is outside the git repository root (operator policy / compose validation)
- Add CI Compose config + image build / health smoke (AC3 only required lint/typecheck)
- Pin base image digests and stop floating `pip install uv` in API Dockerfile
- Harden `docker-compose.prod.yml` (localhost binds, reject placeholder secrets, docs off)
- Rewrite git history to purge previously committed `bank_data/*.pdf` blobs (Ask First)
